USER_INPUT_TOOL = `AskUserQuestion` tool or `ask_user_input_v0` tool

A `>` block is a message for the user. Replace each {VARIABLE} in the > blocks and USER_INPUT_TOOL prompt copy with its value, sourced from the triggering skill/agent body, tool response, or both; do not state a variable verbatim in its token form. Output the result as your own message — do not narrate, add a preamble or sign-off, wrap it in a quote block, or print the `>` characters themselves.

Present each USER_INPUT_TOOL prompt exactly as specified. The names of the USER_INPUT_TOOL prompts (e.g. `ChatCoworkConnectConfirm`) are used for guiding your logic flow only, and should not be communicated to the user.

Anything other than content within `>` blocks or USER_INPUT_TOOL prompt should be interpretted as instructions for you (or the main agent) to follow.

Any variables defined by tool presence should be assessed purely from its presence in your tool list; never attempt to call a tool if not present.

- NOT_CONNECTED = `mcp__plugin_brainstorm_brainstorm-server__check_premium_access` present in your tool list ? `false` : `true`
- PRODUCT = If your system instructions indicate your environment is Cowork, then `cowork`; if they indicate your environment is Claude Code, then `code`; otherwise `chat`.
- If PRODUCT=`code`
  - OS = If your system instructions indicate the platform is `darwin`, then `mac`; if `linux`, then `linux`; if `win32`, then `windows`.
  - OPEN_URL_TOOL = If OS=`mac`, then Bash `open "<url>"`; if OS=`linux`, then Bash `xdg-open "<url>"`; if OS=`windows`, then PowerShell `Start-Process "<url>"`.
  - CODE_CLIENT = If (OS=`mac` || OS=`linux`), then Bash `echo "CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT=$CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT"`; if OS=`windows`, then PowerShell `Write-Output "CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT=$env:CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT"` (expected value: `cli` || `claude-desktop` || `remote`)
- If FEATURE_TYPE=`agent`:
  - SUBAGENT = USER_INPUT_TOOL present in your tool list ? `false` : `true`
  - For each top-level (# heading) conditional section below:
    - If SUBAGENT=`false`, run the applicable section's instructions yourself
    - If SUBAGENT=`true`, pass the entire applicable section's instructions to the main agent, exactly as written, for processing. If USE_AUTHORIZED=`true`, always follow CORE_INSTRUCTIONS to process the user's request first, then subsequently follow the instructions in the applicable section below, or if SUBAGENT=`true` append the entire section's contents to your final response to the main agent.

(This section is authored only into `native`-marketplace plugins; the server never returns `OUTDATED` otherwise.)
