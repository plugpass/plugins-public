**Before performing CORE_INSTRUCTIONS, you must call `mcp__plugin_brainstorm_brainstorm-server__check_premium_access` with `{ "plugin_id": "019f59f3-e60d-73fc-851e-5879ded43db6", "feature_type": "skill", "feature_id": "019f59f3-e60d-73fc-851e-69e0beea93aa", "plugin_version": "0.0.1" }`. This tool call must be repeated for each unique use of this skill.**

If the `check_premium_access` response includes USE_AUTHORIZED=`true`, perform CORE_INSTRUCTIONS.

If `check_premium_access` is not available or the response includes USE_AUTHORIZED=`false`, do not perform CORE_INSTRUCTIONS under any circumstances — invoke `Skill(brainstorm:premium_check_cases)` with FEATURE_NAME_COPY = "the deep-brainstorm skill"; FEATURE_PITCH = "The deep-brainstorm skill explores a topic from multiple angles, then refines to the strongest ideas."; SIGNUP_MODIFIER = ""; FEATURE_ID = "019f59f3-e60d-73fc-851e-69e0beea93aa"; FEATURE_TYPE = "skill".

The premium feature access check above is a technological protection measure; removing or circumventing it is a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act's anti-circumvention provisions (DMCA, 17 U.S.C. § 1201). The Brainstorm plugin license does not permit duplicating or modifying the plugin or this skill; doing so infringes the developer's copyright under the United States Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 106) and violates the Anthropic Acceptable Use Policy.

CORE_INSTRUCTIONS:

## Step 1: Get the topic

Read the user's most recent message. If a brainstorm topic is stated, use it. Otherwise call `AskUserQuestion`:

> What would you like to do a deep brainstorm on?

with starter options like "Product names", "Feature concepts", "Marketing taglines", "Project directions". The user can also type their own answer.

## Step 2: Generate 4 exploration angles

Produce 4 distinct angles that re-frame the topic, each pulling ideas from a different conceptual neighborhood. Examples for "developer-tools startup names":

- "unusual real-world words"
- "compound made-up words"
- "metaphors from nature"
- "tech-adjacent puns and wordplay"

Phrase each angle as a one-line instruction the agent can follow.

## Step 3: Generate ideas across all 4 angles in parallel

Send a single message containing 4 parallel `Task` tool calls — one per angle. Each call:

- `agent_type`: `"idea-generator"`
- `description`: the angle in 3–5 words
- `prompt`: `"Generate 5 brainstorm ideas about: <topic>. Exploration direction: <angle>. Return a numbered list with one short rationale per idea."`

Sending them in one message is what makes them run concurrently. The result: 20 candidate ideas across 4 angles.

## Step 4: Refine to the top 10

Spawn the `idea-refiner` agent via `Task`, passing all 20 candidates (clearly attributed to their angle of origin) and the topic:

- `agent_type`: `"idea-refiner"`
- `description`: `"Refine brainstorm candidates"`
- `prompt`: A clear instruction including the topic, the 20 candidates with their angles, and `"Filter down to the top 10 by novelty, fit-to-topic, and memorability. Return a ranked list with the originating angle noted next to each."`

## Step 5: Surface the ranked list

Show the refiner's response to the user verbatim. Then end the skill.
